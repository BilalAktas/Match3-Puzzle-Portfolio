I'm a Unity game developer with professional experience in delivering and publishing multiple game projects. Due to NDAs and privacy agreements, Iâ€™m unable to share those projects publicly.
This repository serves as my personal portfolio, showcasing various game prototypes I've built from scratch to demonstrate my skills in gameplay programming, systems design, and rapid prototyping using Unity and C#.
